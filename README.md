## What is HexPlora?

HexPlora is a hex crawl companion built for Game Masters running exploration-heavy campaigns in D&D, Pathfinder, and other tabletop RPGs. Upload any map image, lay a customizable hex grid over it, and run your session — tracking fog of war, party tokens, and points of interest as your players explore.

## Features

### Hex Grid Overlay
Drop a fully configurable hexagonal grid over any map image. Adjust hex size, grid offset, column/row count, line color, line thickness, and switch between flat-top and pointy-top orientations. Scale the map to fit your grid perfectly.

### Fog of War
Click hexes to reveal or hide regions. Control fog color and opacity to match your map's style. Reset fog with one click when you're ready for a fresh start.

### Tokens & Points of Interest
Place tokens anywhere on the map. Choose from 20+ built-in icons (castles, villages, skulls, shields, stars, and more), assign colors, add labels, and attach notes. Drag tokens to reposition them as the story unfolds.

### Pan, Zoom & Touch Support
Navigate large maps with mouse wheel zoom, click-and-drag panning, and keyboard arrow keys. Full touch support — pinch to zoom and drag to pan on tablets and phones.

### Undo & Redo
Made a mistake? Full undo/redo history for fog reveals, token placements, and map changes. Never lose progress during a session.

### Map Library
Save multiple maps and switch between them instantly. Every map is a self-contained package — the image, grid settings, fog state, tokens, and view position all travel together. Export maps as files to share with other GMs, or import maps others have shared with you.

### Cloud Sync for Patrons
Support HexPlora on Patreon and unlock cloud storage for up to 25 maps. Your maps sync across devices — prep on your desktop, run the session from your laptop or tablet.

### Screenshot Export
Capture the current view — map, grid, fog, and tokens — as a single composite PNG. Perfect for session recaps, sharing progress with players, or archiving your campaign.
